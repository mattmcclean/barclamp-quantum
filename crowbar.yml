  # Requires allows you to declare that this barclamp relies on
  # another barclamp to provide some of its functionality.
  # All barclamps implicitly rely on the crowbar barclamp.
  requires:
    - mysql # rely on a single other barclamp
    - @crowbar  # rely on another group of barclamps.
  # Member allows you to declare that this barclamp is a member
  # of a group of related barclamp.  A barclamp can be a member of 
  # muliple groups, and a group name can be used instead of a barclamp
  # in a requires: clause by prefixing it with an @ sign. 
  member:
    - openstack
  # Os_support allows you to declare that this barclamp only supports
  # specific operating systems.  If you don't have an os_support
  # section, Crowbar will assume the barclamp works on all the operating
  # systems it supports.  
  os_support:
    - ubuntu-10.10
